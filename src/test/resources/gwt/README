This directory contains the resources necessary to run the Google Web Toolkit unit tests.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific version of GWT. Each of these subdirectories
was created by downloading the distribution and copying the 'www' of sample directories.

Samples like 'DynaTable' require server-side implementation, so its folder is a complete web application,
however gwt-user.jar is added at parent directory to be reused by different samples.
